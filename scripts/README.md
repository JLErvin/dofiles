# Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I use on a day to day basis. 
It should be noted that many of these scripts may not work on your system. 
You may be missing certain dependencies or you might have different variable
names than me (especially depending on how you store you colors)

* `tinybar` a very simple bar script using `lemonbar` that utilizes named pipes to reduce
impact on system resources.
* `rofi_run` a simple script to manage my many rofi launch requirements
* `squash` a bash script to apply user-created themes across applications
  and save colors in various formats. More information [here](https://github.com/JLErivn/squash)
