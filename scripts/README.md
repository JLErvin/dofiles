# Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I use on a day to day basis. 
It should be noted that many of these scripts may not work on your system. 
You may be missing certain dependencies or you might have different variable
names than me (especially depending on how you store you colors)

* `bar` a simple bar script using `lemonbar`
* `infobar2` a minimal block-style bar using `lemonbar` with patched borders
    * `infobar2` is a great replacement if you want to work without 
      notifications. Each icon in the bar is given a different color which represents
      that status of the certain module (this is inspired by dkeg's bar). 
      For example, when your battery is below 20%, the icon will become red. 
* `rofi_run` a simple script to manage my many rofi launch requirements
* `squash` a bash script to apply user-created themes across applications
  and save colors in various formats. More information [here](https://github.com/JLErivn/squash)
