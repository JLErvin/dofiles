These are a collection of scripts that make my system work.
Please note that many of these scripts will not work on your system unless you have the proper
tools installed. Use these as a source of inspiration rather than copy and paste.

* `simplebar`: a lightweight bar that uses `lemonbar` and named-sockets to display system information.
I am using a [custom version](https://github.com/dark-yux/bar) of `lemonbar` that allows for borders.

* `tinyar`: a lightweight bar that uses `lemonbar` and named-sockets to display system information.
I am using a [custom version](https://github.com/dark-yux/bar) of `lemonbar` that allows for borders.
Unlike `simplebar`, this bar has a block-style look.
