# Windowchef

Windowchef is a minimal floating window manager written by Tudurom.
It is an interesting hybrid between two of my favorite window managers, 
`2bwm` and `bspwm`. It shares many similarities with `2bwm`, such as 
floating windows, intuitive resizing, and double borders. However,
its configuration is very similar to `bspwm`, relying on shell scripts
for configuration and a `sxhkd` for key bindings .
