# Scripts

A collection of bash scripts that make my computer what it is. 

* lbar: My system status bar using lemonbar. Inspired by bars from nxll and dkeg. I rewrote this script from scratch 
to make it easier to change the colors of individual modules. 
* panes: quick script to show colors
* startup: startup script to cleanup .xinitrc
