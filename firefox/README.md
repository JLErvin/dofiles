`firefox` is a modern, cross-platfrom browser.
Althought it may be a bit "heavy", I find that browsers like `qutebrowser` are simply
not equipped to handle modern websites and are more of a pain than they're worth.

I have included my `userChrome.css` which adds a custom look to my browser.
Be sure to edit the colors in this file to fit your needs. 
I am using my themeing application, `squash`, to generate a `.css` file which I import at the top of `userChrome.css`.
